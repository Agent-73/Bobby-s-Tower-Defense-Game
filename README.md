# TowerDefenseTemplate
 
	
	In my tower defense game I made 4 enemies. One enemy when at low health shrinks and goes faster, like a slime 
in a game where it shrinks when taking damage. My goblin/elf like enemy has a speed that is dependent on how many of
its fellow enemies are alive on the path. The last two are vanilla enemies, one a rat that is fast but low health, 
and the other is a boss like elf that has a lot of health but moves the slowest. 

	Due to time I only made one tower, at the moment I don't have a completely working game to where it can be 
placed and you get more per wave. The tower is a little farmer that is trying to protect his town, he shoots little 
swords at the enemies. 

	I have a end game screen and working waves. The enemies can take damage when pressing the backspace, and each 
wave is controlled by the enter key. If you want to play many waves at once then you can press the enter key 
multiple times. The damage to your end is different depending on what enemy got there, ranging from 1-5 damage to 
the end which has a health of 10. Then you get a "Game Over" message with a little new map. 

	I attempted extra credit with two different paths but at the moment it works great besides it is not dependent 
whichever is better to get to the end. The plan is to make it read whether there are more towers on the left
or right of the screen but at the moment it is completely random. I would have to finish the towers first before 
finishing the path function.

	In this project I've learned a lot about gdscript and how it is different than programs I have used in the
past. Some of the main struggles I have had is knowing what I need to do, how to take my ideas and make the 
computer understand it which means the more I practice programming the better I should get. I had a lot of file 
errors in this project but hopefully I'll learn to fix these faster in the future!
